- âœ… **Currency Support**: Proper handling of USD, GBP, and GBX currencies with automatic conversion
- âœ… **Persistent Storage**: Last successful stock data is saved and restored across app restarts
- âœ… **Rate Limiting Protection**: Intelligent caching and retry logic to handle API limits
- âœ… **Data Retention**: App shows last known good data when network fetches fail
- âœ… **Preferences UI**: Working preferences panel for adding/removing stocks and currency settings
- âœ… **Color Coding**: Optional green/red color coding for gains/losses
- âœ… **Net Gains Calculation**: Accurate total portfolio gains calculation with proper currency conversion

**What's left to build:**
- ðŸ”„ **Enhanced Error Handling**: More detailed error messages for network failures
- ðŸ”„ **Additional Currency Support**: Support for more international currencies
