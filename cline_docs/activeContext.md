This file describes what I am currently working on, recent changes, and next steps.

**Current task:**
Recently completed major improvements to the StockBar application including persistent storage for stock data, currency conversion fixes, and menu bar display improvements.

**Recent changes:**
1. **Persistent Storage Implementation**: Added ability to save and restore last successful stock data across app restarts
2. **Currency Conversion Fixes**: Fixed GBX/GBP conversion issues in net gains calculation
3. **Menu Bar Improvements**: Fixed main status item to show "StockBar" instead of individual stock data
4. **Retry Logic**: Implemented 15-minute refresh intervals with 5-minute retry for failed fetches
5. **Data Retention**: App now retains last successful prices when network fetches fail
6. **Enhanced Caching**: Added intelligent caching to reduce API requests and handle rate limiting

**Next steps:**
1. Test the persistent storage functionality across app restarts
2. Verify currency conversion calculations are accurate
3. Monitor API rate limiting and caching effectiveness
4. Consider additional UI improvements based on user feedback
