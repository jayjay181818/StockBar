# Active Context

This file describes what I am currently working on, recent changes, and next steps.

**Current task:**
The user wants to know how to push a v2.0.0 tag to the testing branch of the GitHub repository `https://github.com/jayjay181818/StockBar/tree/testing` and include a message in the tag indicating it is not currently working.

**Recent changes:**
Created the `cline_docs` directory and `productContext.md` file.

**Next steps:**
1. Create the remaining Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
2. Ask the user for the information needed to populate the Memory Bank files.
3. Once the Memory Bank is populated, provide instructions on how to push the tag to the GitHub repository.
