# System Patterns

This file describes how the system is built, key technical decisions, and architecture patterns.

**How the system is built:**
The system is built as a native macOS application using Swift.

**Key technical decisions:**
Key technical decisions include using Swift for development, likely leveraging SwiftUI for UI elements and AppKit for menu bar specific functionalities. A dedicated networking layer handles external data fetching.

**Architecture patterns:**
The architecture appears to follow a client-side application pattern with distinct layers for UI, data handling, and networking.
