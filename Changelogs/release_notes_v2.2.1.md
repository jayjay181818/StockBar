# StockBar v2.2.1 - Enhanced Chart Scaling for Better Price Movement Visibility

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Fix Release

This patch release significantly improves chart readability by implementing dynamic Y-axis scaling based on actual data ranges, making price movements much more visible and meaningful.

## ðŸ“ˆ Chart Improvements

### Enhanced Y-Axis Scaling
- **Dynamic Range Calculation**: Charts now scale from the lowest to highest price in the selected time range
- **Optimal Padding**: Added 5% padding above and below data range for perfect visualization
- **Adaptive Scaling**: Automatically adjusts when switching between time periods (1 Day to All Time)
- **Improved Granularity**: Increased Y-axis marks to 8 for better precision and readability

### Problem Solved
**Before**: Charts often showed flat-looking lines with excessive whitespace, making small but significant price movements invisible or misleading.

**After**: Charts now dynamically scale to show the actual price range, making every movement clearly visible and analytically meaningful.

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Improvements

### Better Price Movement Visibility
- **Small Changes Visible**: Minor price fluctuations now clearly displayed
- **Trend Analysis**: Easier to spot upward/downward trends and patterns
- **Proportional Scaling**: Chart scale matches actual data significance
- **Consistent Experience**: Works seamlessly across all time ranges

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Immediate Impact**: Charts instantly look more professional and informative
- **Better Decision Making**: Clearer visualization leads to better investment insights
- **Reduced Confusion**: No more misleadingly flat charts
- **Professional Appearance**: Charts now match financial industry standards

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Core Changes
- **New `yAxisDomain` Property**: Calculates dynamic Y-axis range from actual data
- **Smart Padding Algorithm**: Adds 5% buffer for optimal visual spacing
- **Edge Case Handling**: Gracefully handles zero-range and single-point data
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient calculation with no impact on chart responsiveness

### Code Quality
```swift
private var yAxisDomain: ClosedRange<Double> {
    guard !chartData.isEmpty else { return 0...1 }
    
    let values = chartData.map { $0.value }
    let minValue = values.min() ?? 0
    let maxValue = values.max() ?? 1
    
    // Add 5% padding for optimal visualization
    let range = maxValue - minValue
    let padding = range * 0.05
    
    return (minValue - padding)...(maxValue + padding)
}
```

### Integration
- **Seamless Integration**: Applied via `.chartYScale(domain: yAxisDomain)` modifier
- **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes to existing functionality
- **Hover Tooltips**: Continue to work perfectly with new scaling
- **Performance Metrics**: Unaffected by scaling improvements

## ðŸŽ¯ Impact

### For Portfolio Analysis
- **Trend Identification**: Much easier to spot performance patterns
- **Volatility Assessment**: Better visualization of price movement ranges

- Portfolio change of $50: Lost in scale from $0 to $10,000

### After v2.2.1
- Stock moving from $150.00 to $152.00: Clear upward trend visible
