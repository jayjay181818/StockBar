## 🔧 Phase 4: Polish & Quality
*Focus: Developer experience, testing, and documentation*

### 16a. Live Cache Refresh Reliability ✅

- **Fixed refresh deadlock:** removed a double acquisition of `RefreshCoordinator` that prevented staggered fetches from running after cache clears or app launch.
- **Instant recovery:** new `refreshSymbolsImmediately` / `refreshCriticalSymbols` helpers kick off batch refreshes for any "Never fetched" stocks as soon as data loads, services initialise, or you press **Clear All Caches** / **Retry Now**.
- **Safer logging:** targets are de-duped case-insensitively before hitting the network so the inspector and logs always reflect the real fetch list.
- **Result:** Cache Inspector now transitions straight to **Fresh/Stale** states after a reset, the menu bar update timestamp moves forward again, and the staggered loop keeps cycling through every symbol without starving the tail end of the list.

### 16. Improved Debug Tools 🛠️

**Professional-Grade Debugging Capabilities**

New comprehensive debugging tools make troubleshooting easy and give you complete visibility into Stockbar's internal state.

**🔍 Cache Inspector - See What's Happening:**
- **Status Dashboard** - Shows cache status for first 10 stocks at a glance
- **Color-Coded Indicators:**
  - 🟢 **Green** = Fresh cache (< 15 minutes old) - everything's working
  - 🟠 **Orange** = Stale or failed with retry scheduled
  - 🔴 **Red** = Expired or suspended (circuit breaker active)
  - ⚪ **Gray** = Never fetched (new stock)

**Quick Actions:**
- **"Retry Now"** button for suspended symbols (override circuit breaker)
- **"Clear All Caches"** button (force refresh everything)
- **"Refresh Cache View"** button (update the inspector display)

**🛠️ Advanced Debug Tools:**
- **📊 Simulate Market Closed Mode** - Test behavior when markets are closed (great for development)
- **📦 Export Debug Report** - One-click bundle of all diagnostic data:
  - Current configuration (currency, refresh interval, portfolio size)
  - Cache statistics (fresh/stale/expired counts)
  - Per-symbol cache status
  - Portfolio summary (total stocks, net gains, total value)
  - Complete `stockbar.log` file
  - Full `portfolio.json` export
- **📂 Auto-Open in Finder** - Debug report automatically opens after export

**Perfect For:**
- Diagnosing "why isn't my stock updating?" issues
- Providing diagnostic data when reporting bugs
- Understanding internal cache behavior
- Testing market-closed scenarios
- Generating support tickets with full context

## 🐛 Bug Fixes & Reliability Improvements

Beyond new features, v2.2.10 includes numerous fixes and reliability enhancements:

### Data Integrity & Validation
- ✅ **Invalid Price Filtering** - Automatically removes NaN and infinite values before they reach your portfolio
- ✅ **Range Enforcement** - Price validation ($0.01-$1M) and units validation (0.001-1B) prevent invalid data entry
- ✅ **UK Stock Handling** - Proper GBX to GBP conversion (÷100) for all UK stocks (BP.L, LLOY.L, etc.)
- ✅ **Currency Validation** - Only supported currencies (USD, GBP, EUR, JPY, CAD, AUD) accepted

### Network Reliability & Error Handling
- ✅ **Exponential Backoff** - Progressive retry delays (1m → 2m → 5m → 10m) prevent API rate limiting
- ✅ **Circuit Breaker** - Automatic suspension after 5 consecutive failures prevents wasted bandwidth
- ✅ **Timeout Protection** - 30-second process timeout prevents hanging requests
- ✅ **Error Recovery** - Graceful handling of all network error types with user-friendly messages
- ✅ **Structured Errors** - JSON error format replaces cryptic failure messages

### UI/UX Enhancements
- ✅ **Real-Time Validation** - Instant visual feedback (orange warning icons) on input errors
- ✅ **Color-Coded Status** - Visual indicators throughout UI (🟢 fresh, 🟠 stale, 🔴 suspended)
- ✅ **Actionable Errors** - Every error message includes next steps ("Check spelling", "Retry in 60s")
- ✅ **Dark Mode** - Complete appearance support with semantic colors
- ✅ **Smooth Performance** - Zero UI lag, smooth animations, <5% CPU usage

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Workarounds

### 1. Yahoo Finance Rate Limiting (Large Portfolios)

**Issue:** Users with 20+ stocks may occasionally encounter rate limiting from Yahoo Finance API.

**Symptoms You Might See:**
- 🔴 Stocks stop updating after multiple refreshes
- ⚠️ Error message: "Rate limit reached. Retry in XXs."
- 🟠 Symbols enter suspended state (circuit breaker activates)

**Immediate Workarounds:**

**Option A: Use Manual Retry (Quick Fix)**
1. Open **Preferences → Debug tab**
2. Find affected symbol in **Cache Inspector**
3. Click **"Retry Now"** button to override suspension

**Option B: Increase Refresh Interval (Permanent Fix)**
```bash
defaults write com.fhl43211.Stockbar refreshInterval 600
```
*(Changes interval from 5 minutes to 10 minutes)*

**Long-Term Solutions (Planned for v2.2.11):**
- 🔄 **Adaptive rate limiting** - Automatically adjusts interval based on API responses
- 🕐 **Smart market hours** - Reduces refresh frequency when markets are closed
- ⚙️ **UI interval picker** - User-friendly control in Preferences

**Note:** This is a limitation of Yahoo Finance's free API, not a Stockbar bug. The circuit breaker and exponential backoff features in v2.2.10 help manage this gracefully.

---

### 2. NSUserNotification Deprecation Warning

**Issue:** Pre-existing compiler warning about deprecated `NSUserNotification` API.

**Impact:** ✅ **None** - API remains fully functional on macOS 11+ through macOS 15+

**Future Plan:** Migrate to modern `UserNotifications` framework in a future release. This is a low-priority item since current implementation works perfectly.

     - 📋 **Copy Command** - Copies `pip3 install yfinance` to clipboard
     - 🖥️ **Open Terminal** - Launches Terminal.app for you
     - ✖️ **Dismiss** - Continue anyway (stocks won't update without it)
   - This check only runs once per installation

2. **💾 Automatic First Backup**
   - Your first portfolio backup is created automatically
   - Location: `~/Library/Application Support/Stockbar/Backups/`
